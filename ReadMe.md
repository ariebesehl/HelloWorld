# Hello World using ZDK



Hello World examples with [ZaidaTek Development Kit](https://github.com/ZaidaTek/ZDK)



## Description

The ZaidaTek Development Kit, or ZDK for short, is a library designed to simplify the usage of C-code in a multitude of settings.

Primarily designed to reduce boiler-plate code for opening GUI-windows, it has been developed with (future) cross-platform compatibility in mind.

These four examples show its basic implementations.

Fully compiled examples that include the necessary ZDK runtimes, can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/ariebesehl/HelloWorld/raw/main/__latest.zip). Extract to folder of your choice, and execute the applications.

An example showing how to create pixel graphics, and present them on screen, using OpenGL as a renderer.

Each pixel is displayed using a randomized color every frame.


## Hello UI
